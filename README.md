# Dall-e-image-editor

This web application enables users to generate and edit images by selecting portions of images and inputting text. Users can choose to generate images from a geenrated image or start with one of their choice, utilizing requests to the Dall-e API. After registering and logging in, users need to add an API key to their profile for generation requests. Generated images are saved in a user-specific history for easy access and reference.
